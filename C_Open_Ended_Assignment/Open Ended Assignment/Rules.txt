|	Basics:                                                           |
|	There is a code made up of a set number of numbers, the length of |
|     the code is user defined by the difficulty                        |
|	The goal is to get the sequence of colours in the correct order   |
|                                                                         |
|	How to Play:                                                      |
|	first of all you will guess the first code (the program will tell |
|	you which colours are available to be chosen from), after that    |
|	you'll be told how many colours are correct, and how many are in  |
|	the correct position. you then guess again repeatedly until you   |
|	Get the correct sequence and you win                              | 
|                                                                         |
